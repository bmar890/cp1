    <h1 class="home_header">Legal Disclaimer!</h1>

    <p class="disclaimer">Owing to recent events, we here at the Stock Market have been required to deny all claims previously made which involve the possession of ownership of these stock images. The purpose of the images is literally very specifically to be usable by literally anyone, and we do not claim to be the ones who own any or all rights to them at all. See, none of this legal stuff would be necessary if it weren't for Gerald Harper coming in and doing a lawsuit. Everything was going just fine before you came along and ruined it all with your ridiculous complaints, <em>Gerald.</em> We could have all kept on having such a great day if you hadn't come along and ruined everything! "Oh, I can't believe I spent $845 on a bunch of photos that are all online!" "Oh, I can't believe this company is so irresponsible!" "Oh, everything taking place within the four walls of that company is in direct violation of business ethics <em>and</em> human ethics!" So what? If you think you're so good at running a "legal" and "morally correct" business, then why don't you do it yourself, Gerald? Huh? Why don't you stop complaining about the stuff that everyone else is doing and get your own life in check, huh? We've all seen the way that you leave your house all dirty just from the background of your court process Zoom call, Gerald! We know you can't keep a place clean, and I'm pretty sure that you were eating soup out of a cooking pot, so maybe before you start talking about "human ethics," you ought to start looking around your own house, you know? Your brat kid kept showing up on the call when it was supposed to be a very formal call, Gerald! You seriously think that you could keep an entire business in check when you can't even keep a single kid in check? And no matter how many allegations you make, it won't change the fact that you're a total tool! Honestly, we're all just here trying to live our lives, and if it weren't for you, then we wouldn't have needed to shell out so much money for a lawyer. Seriously! Lawyers are wicked expensive! And even though we lost the case, that guy still charged us in full for "legal fees" or something like that! Plus, he kept showing up late to meetings and stuff! For reals! Gerald, do you remember that one time when we had that call with the judge, and that guy didn't even show up for, like, 8 minutes! He was supposed to already be there, but instead he comes on way late and <strong>everyone</strong> can still hear the Game of Thrones intro like he wasn't <em>just</em> watching it! Plus, every time we talked with that guy in person, he smelled like onions for some reason. Like, EVERY TIME. I swear the guy must've been living on French onion soup or something. And I'm not even talking, like, the good kind of French onion soup! I'm talking that really rancid stuff that you buy at a gas station in a plastic tin that takes way too long to pull apart. Honestly, if you want a good French onion soup, and I mean a <strong>good</strong> French onion soup, you gotta head down to Applebee's. I'm serious! You'd think that a place like Applebee's wouldn't know how to make a half-decent French onion soup, but they seriously nail it there. Granted, it's pretty small and it costs $4, but seriously, it's delicious. Anyway, I feel like I've gotten off track at some point along the line here, but in summary: We don't own these photos, Gerald's a tool, and go to Applebee's for a really good French onion soup. Also, seriously, I don't feel like we're equipped for the kind of legal jargon that they expect of us here. It feels like we should've just hired a lawyer or someone like that to write it, but as you can probably guess, we're not feeling too hot vis a vis lawyer stuff lately. Maybe an accountant does this kind of thing? I feel like we should've hired one of those too maybe? I mean, like, in general, but maybe they know how to account for legal problems? That seems like a bit of a stretch. Anyway, they just kind of told us that things needed to change around here or something like that, but then they went and left before we could even ask who <em>they</em> were, so that whole thing was sort of pointless. Still, I know how much money we dropped on a lawyer last time and how many times I had to smell rancid French onion soup-adjacent smells when dealing with one, so I guess I can't really complain. Well, I mean, <em>I</em> can complain. I'm not supposed to be well-versed in the whole "legal" thing.</p>
